# Visualization Master Task
## Short description
Additional task for Master students at the Visualization class @ Otto-von-Guericke Universit√§t Magdeburg.

My goal was to visually expore the two following questions:
- **Q1:**  Is there a correlation between the number of public transport stations and the crime rate in Buenos Aires in 2022?

- **Q2:** For each commune in the City of Buenos Aires, what was the crime - hour of day distribution?

The final result can be found [in this Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/a51e16d0da92f37c)

## What this repo contains
The Observable notebook contains the final result, with the final visualizations.

This repo contains some insight into how I prepared all the data, including
- Sources to the data-sets
- Data preparation and normalization

## How to run it
This is mainly a collection of Jupyter Notebooks in which Python & Pandas are mainly used. A *requirements.txt* file has been added to facilitate the installation of libraries.

As with any Python / PIP project, I would advise you to use a virtual environment for the installation.
